				<h1>Broken facilities in a queer Bronx homeless shelter go unfixed for years</h1> 
				<h2> By Sunny Nagpaul</h2>
				<h3> November 16, 2023</h3>


				<!-- Great ipsum texts: http://meettheipsums.com/ | this one is Sagan ipsum: http://saganipsum.com/ -->
				<p class="first-graph">Marsha’s House, located in Belmont in The Bronx, is the only queer friendly shelter for adults in the city, but it’s not the safe haven most of the queer homeless population needs. The facility has issues like mold, poop-smeared bathrooms and showers that only release scalding hot water that burns residents’ skin, which according to freedom of information records, has been ongoing since April 2020. Even though shelters are inspected annually by the city’s departments of homeless and social services, the facility, along with many others in the city, is often broken for years. </p>

				<p class="second-graph">Jha’asryel-Akquil Bishop arrived in the U.S. from Guyana in 2016 as an asylum seeker. They lived with their uncle for just one month before they had a disagreement and Bishop’s uncle kicked them out. Almost a decade later, they are still homeless, bouncing from shelter to shelter until last year. Then they were placed at Marsha’s House, the only queer-friendly shelter in the city. But their troubles were not over. </p>

<p class="third-graph">Since moving into Marsha’s House almost a year ago, Bishop said the showers release scalding hot water that burns their skin and has given them rashes, blisters and dry skin.</p> 

<p class="fourth-graph">The bathrooms are so dirty that residents are concerned about the transmission of diseases. FOIL documents show that one shelter resident complained that “there is a person or persons leaving poop smear all over in a lot of the restrooms. Directors know about this, this is still happening.” Bishop was diagnosed with a tapeworm infection and doesn’t know where it came from, but is also concerned about it spreading to other residents through the dirty bathrooms.</p> 

<p class="fifth-graph">The shelter’s layout, with little privacy and several beds in one room, is also particularly unsettling for queer homeless people, many of whom carry the trauma of physical or sexual abuse. For asylum seekers, like Bishop, help is hard to come by.</p>

<p class="sixth-graph">The New York State Comptroller releases audits on how well OTDA and DHS regulate and inspect the city’s homeless shelters. The most recent report in 2020 stated that 64% of 80 shelters they reviewed had significant health and safety risks, and that “violations from our 2016 and 2017 audits have gone uncorrected and, in certain cases, have gotten worse.” Peter Carroll, one of the comptroller’s audit writers, said that corrective action plans, reports which the city’s departments are supposed to file when a facility needs more than 30 days to fix, were not timely filed and that, "I think our audit pointed out a really significant hole in that process. There was no verification that repairs to violations were actually made.</p>

				<p>The city’s department of homeless services record shelter report card data on how many violations were reported at each shelter per given month. Their most recent report, from February 2023, described that Manhattan shelters had the most violations at 2.2 violations per shelter. The Bronx had much less, at 0.4 violations per shelter. Marsha’s House had zero violations listed in the last several months, but a current resident at Marsha’s House said that the showers still only release scalding hot water that burns them.</p>

				<p> A review of the last five months of data reported by the city’s department of homeless services show that Manhattan shelters have more open violations than other shelters in the city, and had the most violations in January 2023. A member of the state’s comptroller office, Peter Carroll, directed a series of audit reports to assess how well city entities like DHS and OTDA inspect shelters and found that lack of communication between the city and shelter landlords or providers, missing corrective action plans, and lack of awareness of grants and financial aid are reasons that things stay broken at shelters for years.</p>
